"""Govern an Azure AI Foundry Agents tool call with ACS, end to end.

This is a *real* integration reference, not a mocked one. It uses the genuine
Azure AI Foundry Agents SDK (``azure-ai-agents``) to declare function tools, and
it makes a real Azure OpenAI call: the ACS policy is backed by an LLM judge that
classifies each tool argument before the tool is allowed to run. Nothing here is
stubbed with canned JSON, so it doubles as a live smoke test.

Run it with real credentials set (see ``_common.require_azure``)::

    export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=...        # https://<resource>.openai.azure.com
    export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=...
    export AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=...       # e.g. gpt-4o / gpt-5.x
    export AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=...      # e.g. 2025-04-01-preview
    pip install "agent-control-specification" azure-ai-agents
    python foundry_agents.py

It demonstrates two integration styles for the *same* governed seam:

* the short path -- ``control.protect_tool(...)`` returns a drop-in async
  wrapper that evaluates PRE_TOOL_CALL and POST_TOOL_CALL, applies any
  transform, and raises ``AgentControlBlocked`` on a deny; and
* the long path -- you call ``control.evaluate_intervention_point(...)``
  yourself and branch on ``verdict.decision`` (allow / deny / escalate /
  transform), which is what you want when wiring ACS into a framework's own
  tool-dispatch hook.

Security invariant: a destructive tool call is *never* executed. That holds for
both a real judge deny and a fail-closed transient, so it is the assertion this
example verifies. Because the judge is a live model, a transient infrastructure
error surfaces as a fail-closed ``annotation_failed`` verdict; the host pattern
is to retry that (a real policy deny is never retried), shown in ``govern``.

How to wire this into a live Foundry agent: register the same callables with
``FunctionTool``/``ToolSet`` and route the SDK's auto function-call hook (the
point where Foundry invokes your Python tool) through ``protect_tool`` so every
tool the agent decides to call is gated by ACS first.
